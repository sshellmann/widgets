The Widget Store

A store for widgets. Any shape, size, or color you could want.

Administration is handled by the django-admin functionality.

Notes on backend:
  * Move off sqlite
  * Order creation is currently split into the order creation and the order item
    creation. This could be improved by completing it as one step. Would require
    more clever manipulation of the rest serializers than I am unwilling to do
    at this point.
  * Serializers are a bit messy and would greatly benefit from docstrings
  * OrderItemWidgetRepresentation is incredibly complex and is manipulating
    internals of the Rest Framework
  * Implement AND for feature filtering

Notes on frontend:
  * Make it less ugly
  * Use flux to manage data
  * Convert all setStates to use the react update helper
    * Remove lodash after that is done
  * Error handling on the page
  * Suggestions in a drop-down  for filtering on features would help
